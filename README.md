# Petra & Luka's Wedding Website

This is a heavily vibe-coded web page for the most important day in the life of my Petra and me :)

## Overview

This project is a custom-built, interactive wedding invitation and information hub designed to celebrate our special day. It features smooth scrolling animations, a romantic timeline, and essential logistics for our guests, all wrapped in a personalized design.

## Features

-   **Interactive Timeline:** A scroll-triggered journey through our relationship and wedding day schedule.
-   **Music Player:** Integrated background music with playback controls.
-   **Quiz Section:** A fun little quiz to test how well guests know us.
-   **Logistics Information:** Details on location, parking, transportation, and packing tips.
-   **Responsive Design:** Optimized for different screen sizes.

## Technology Stack

-   **HTML5 & CSS3:** For structure and styling.
-   **JavaScript (ES6):** For logic and interactivity.
-   **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform):** Powered by `gsap.min.js` and `ScrollTrigger.min.js` for high-performance scroll-driven animations.
-   **Google Fonts:** Using 'Gveret Levin' and 'Montserrat'.
